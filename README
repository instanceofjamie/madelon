Madelon is a little script that makes use of libcloud to:

 * Provision a server (by default, in the Rackspace Cloud)
 * Install puppet and git on it, and
 * Deploy and execute standalone puppet manifests

Dependencies
------------

 * python
 * libcloud
 * python-paramiko
 * ruby
 * rubygems
 * libopenssl-ruby
 * capistrano
 * git-core
 * You need an ssh private/public keypair in the .ssh directory of the user you're executing frigg as, because the public key will be copied to the new VPS to let you login.
 * My libcloud fork (git://github.com/mig5/libcloud.git) has a patch to catch the root user's password to stdout (not that useful since you need a key anyway))
 * If using a private repo, currently requires a copy of known_hosts and the private key is copied up to the server so it can git clone a private repo from github.

Usage
-----

 * edit config/madelon.ini if necessary
 * python madelon some.example.com


Caveats
--------

 * Still some ways to go to make it work with other providers behind Libcloud (Linode requires python-json and it doesn't work yet. Rackspace Cloud & Slicehost work well)
 * The private repo stuff, as above, depends on a known_hosts file etc. This could surely be handled better.
 * Needs more dependency checking such as libopenssl-ruby which I always forget to install.
 * Capistrano. I wouldn't mind porting that stuff to Fabric to make it all Python :)
