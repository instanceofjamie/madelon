Madelon is a little script that makes use of libcloud to:

 * Provision a server (by default, in the Rackspace Cloud)
 * Fire off any hooks set to 'enabled' in config/madelon.ini that exist in the subdirectory 'hooks'. These hooks would typically be fabric files to run additional tasks on the new node. An example 'aegir' and 'puppet' hook are provided as an example.

Dependencies
------------

 * python
 * fabric
 * libcloud

Usage
-----

 * edit config/madelon.ini if necessary
 * add relevant hooks as required
 * python madelon --fqdn=some.example.com
